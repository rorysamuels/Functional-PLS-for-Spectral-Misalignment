This repo includes an implementation of of functional partial least squares (FPLS) regression along with an application to spectral misalignment. Specifically, for cases where remote sensing insruments have different spectral resolutions (i.e. they are misaligned), it is important to have a calibration model that is invariant to the the wavelength sampling to maintain accurate predictions of ground-based trait data. In \texttt{fpls\_slides}, an explanation of FPLS is offered along with some results on simulated misaligned spectral data.
